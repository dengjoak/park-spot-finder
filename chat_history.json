[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "\ud83d\udd27 AI Developer Prompt \u2013 Build the ParkinPal Mobile App\n\nYou are tasked with developing ParkinPal, a smart mobile parking app that helps users find, book, access, and pay for urban parking spots digitally. Your goal is to create a seamless, user-friendly experience on both iOS and Android platforms.\n\n\ud83c\udf0d Purpose and Overview\nParkinPal provides access to a network of underutilized private parking spaces\u2014such as office buildings and hotels\u2014making them publicly available through a mobile platform. It optimizes city mobility by allowing drivers to locate and reserve affordable, nearby parking in real time, without the hassle of street searching.\n\n\ud83d\udcf1 Core Features\nSearch & Map Integration\n\nUsers can search for parking near a destination or use current GPS location.\n\nDisplay results on an interactive map with dynamic pins showing price and availability.\n\nAllow filtering by price, distance, or availability window.\n\nReal-Time Availability & Pricing\n\nShow live parking spot availability with up-to-date prices.\n\nInclude visual indicators like price tags and color-coded availability levels on the map.\n\nBooking & Instant Parking\n\nUsers can choose to:\n\n\"Park now\" at available locations.\n\nBook a spot for a future time by selecting date and duration (2h, 4h, 8h, etc.).\n\nConfirm booking with a breakdown of pricing, fees, and any discount codes.\n\nSession Management\n\nShow active parking sessions with a live countdown timer.\n\nProvide options to:\n\nExtend time.\n\nEnd session early.\n\nNavigate to the location.\n\nWarn users before session expiry.\n\nDigital Access Control\n\nAllow users to open parking gates directly from the app.\n\nGate access may use Bluetooth, QR codes, or API triggers (based on backend capability).\n\nSecure access tied to booking and session validation.\n\nPayment & Receipts\n\nAccept card payments or digital wallets.\n\nDisplay full breakdown: base fee, service fee, discount applied, and total.\n\nSave transaction history and provide downloadable receipts.\n\nAccount & History\n\nUsers can view past and upcoming sessions, including address, photo, and timestamps.\n\nManage vehicle license plates and user profile.\n\nAuthentication via email, OAuth, or phone number.\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 UI/UX Design\nClean, modern interface with:\n\nTab navigation: Parking, Sessions, My Account.\n\nYellow and black branding, card-based layout.\n\nFloating markers and pricing on the map.\n\nEnsure responsiveness, accessibility, and clarity for all UI elements.\n\n\ud83e\udde9 Technical Details\nPlatform: Cross-platform (React Native or Flutter).\n\nIntegrations:\n\nGoogle Maps SDK for location and routing.\n\nPayment SDK (e.g., Stripe or Adyen).\n\nAuth: OAuth 2.0 / JWT.\n\nBackend APIs: parking data, booking logic, gate control, payment processing.\n\nFeatures:\n\nLocation services.\n\nOffline caching for recent destinations.\n\nPush notifications for session alerts.\n\nMultilingual support (initial: English and Dutch).\n\n\ud83d\udd10 Compliance & Performance\nGDPR-compliant data handling.\n\nFast load times and smooth animations.\n\nSecure API communication (HTTPS, tokens).\n\nEnsure app scalability for use across major European cities.\n\nDeliverables:\nA fully functional ParkinPal app for iOS and Android, ready for end-user testing, with backend integration, clean UI, and robust session/payment handling.\n\nLet me know if you'd like this turned into a project spec or developer story format!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}], "user_id": "user_2yKvlbzmzCCcJEifeBSLeywV9Tq"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will create a plan to build the ParkinPal mobile app, focusing on a seamless and user-friendly experience across both iOS and Android platforms.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1.  **Explore the project structure:** Use `read_file_tree()` to understand the existing file organization and identify key areas for modification and addition.\n2.  **Implement core features:** Plan the implementation of the following core features for the initial version:\n\n    *   An interactive map screen with dynamic pins showing parking spots, prices, and availability, integrating the Google Maps SDK.\n    *   A booking screen that allows users to \"Park now\" or book for a future time, displaying a clear breakdown of pricing and fees.\n    *   A \"My Account\" screen where users can manage their profile, view past/upcoming sessions, and manage payment methods.\n3.  **Design elements:** Consider the following visual aspects:\n\n    *   Colors: Base color of yellow and black branding, with appropriate text and highlight shades.\n    *   Typography: Modern, clean fonts to ensure readability and a contemporary feel.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type":
